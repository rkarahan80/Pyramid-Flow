## Introduction

![motivation](assets/motivation.jpg)

Existing video diffusion models operate at full resolution, spending a lot of computation on very noisy latents. By contrast, our method harnesses the flexibility of flow matching ([Lipman et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PqvMRDCJT9t); [Liu et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XVjTT1nw5z); [Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=li7qeBbCR1t)) to interpolate between latents of different resolutions and noise levels, allowing for simultaneous generation and decompression of visual content with better computational efficiency. The entire framework is end-to-end optimized with a single DiT ([Peebles & Xie, 2023](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Peebles_Scalable_Diffusion_Models_with_Transformers_ICCV_2023_paper.html)), generating high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

## Installation

We recommend setting up the environment with conda. The codebase currently uses Python 3.8.10 and PyTorch 2.1.2 ([guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v212)), and we are actively working to support a wider range of versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow
cd Pyramid-Flow

# create env using conda
conda create -n pyramid python==3.8.10
conda activate pyramid
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rain1011) (there are two variants: [miniFLUX](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-miniflux) or [SD3](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3)). The miniFLUX models support 1024p image, 384p and 768p video generation, and the SD3-based models support 768p and 384p video generation. The 384p checkpoint generates 5-second video at 24FPS, while the 768p checkpoint generates up to 10-second video at 24FPS.

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

model_path = 'PATH'   # The local directory to save downloaded checkpoint
snapshot_download("rain1011/pyramid-flow-miniflux", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, repo_type='model')
```

## Inference

### 1. Quick start with Gradio

To get started, first install [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart), set your model path at [#L36](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/3777f8b84bddfa2aa2b497ca919b3f40567712e6/app.py#L36), and then run on your local machine:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio demo will be opened in a browser. Thanks to [@tpc2233](https://github.com/tpc2233) the commit, see [#48](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/48) for details.

Or, try it out effortlessly on [Hugging Face Space ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pyramid-Flow/pyramid-flow) created by [@multimodalart](https://huggingface.co/multimodalart). Due to GPU limits, this online demo can only generate 25 frames (export at 8FPS or 24FPS). Duplicate the space to generate longer videos.

#### Quick Start on Google Colab

To quickly try out Pyramid Flow on Google Colab, run the code below:

```
# Setup
!git clone https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow
%cd Pyramid-Flow
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install gradio

# This code downloads miniFLUX
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

model_path = '/content/Pyramid-Flow'
snapshot_download("rain1011/pyramid-flow-miniflux", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, repo_type='model')

# Start
!python app.py
```

### 2. Inference Code

To use our model, please follow the inference code in `video_generation_demo.ipynb` at [this link](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/video_generation_demo.ipynb). We strongly recommend you to try the latest published pyramid-miniflux, which shows great improvement on human structure and motion stability. Set the param `model_name` to `pyramid_flux` to use. We further simplify it into the following two-step procedure. First, load the downloaded model:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from pyramid_dit import PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration
from diffusers.utils import load_image, export_to_video

torch.cuda.set_device(0)
# model_dtype, torch_dtype = 'bf16', torch.bfloat16   # Use bf16 for bfloat16 support
model_dtype, torch_dtype = 'fp16', torch.float16     # Use fp16 for float16 support (requires GPU with Compute Capability >= 7.0)
# model_dtype, torch_dtype = 'fp32', torch.float32   # Use fp32 for float32 support

model = PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration(
    'PATH',                                         # The downloaded checkpoint dir
    model_name="pyramid_flux",
    model_dtype=model_dtype,
    model_variant='diffusion_transformer_768p',
)

model.vae.enable_tiling()
# model.vae.to("cuda")
# model.dit.to("cuda")
# model.text_encoder.to("cuda")

# if you're not using sequential offloading bellow uncomment the lines above ^
model.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
```

Then, you can try text-to-video generation on your own prompts. Noting that the 384p version only support 5s now (set temp up to 16)! 

```python
prompt = "A movie trailer featuring the adventures of the 30 year old space man wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style, shot on 35mm film, vivid colors"

# used for 384p model variant
# width = 640
# height = 384

# used for 768p model variant
width = 1280
height = 768

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate(
        prompt=prompt,
        num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20],
        video_num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        height=height,     
        width=width,
        temp=16,                    # temp=16: 5s, temp=31: 10s
        guidance_scale=7.0,         # The guidance for the first frame, set it to 7 for 384p variant
        video_guidance_scale=5.0,   # The guidance for the other video latent
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./text_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

As an autoregressive model, our model also supports (text conditioned) image-to-video generation:

```python
# used for 384p model variant
# width = 640
# height = 384

# used for 768p model variant
width = 1280
height = 768

image = Image.open('assets/the_great_wall.jpg').convert("RGB").resize((width, height))
prompt = "FPV flying over the Great Wall"

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate_i2v(
        prompt=prompt,
        input_image=image,
        num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        temp=16,
        video_guidance_scale=4.0,
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./image_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

#### CPU offloading

We also support two types of CPU offloading to reduce GPU memory requirements. Note that they may sacrifice efficiency.
* Adding a `cpu_offloading=True` parameter to the generate function allows inference with **less than 12GB** of GPU memory. This feature was contributed by [@Ednaordinary](https://github.com/Ednaordinary), see [#23](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/23) for details.
* Calling `model.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()` before the above procedure allows inference with **less than 8GB** of GPU memory. This feature was contributed by [@rodjjo](https://github.com/rodjjo), see [#75](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/75) for details.

#### MPS backend

Thanks to [@niw](https://github.com/niw), Apple Silicon users (e.g. MacBook Pro with M2 24GB) can also try our model using the MPS backend! Please see [#113](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/113) for the details.

### 3. Multi-GPU Inference

For users with multiple GPUs, we provide an [inference script](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/scripts/inference_multigpu.sh) that uses sequence parallelism to save memory on each GPU. This also brings a big speedup, taking only 2.5 minutes to generate a 5s, 768p, 24fps video on 4 A100 GPUs (vs. 5.5 minutes on a single A100 GPU). Run it on 2 GPUs with the following command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 sh scripts/inference_multigpu.sh
```

It currently supports 2 or 4 GPUs (For SD3 Version), with more configurations available in the original script. You can also launch a [multi-GPU Gradio demo](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/scripts/app_multigpu_engine.sh) created by [@tpc2233](https://github.com/tpc2233), see [#59](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/59) for details.

  > Spoiler: We didn't even use sequence parallelism in training, thanks to our efficient pyramid flow designs.

### 4. Usage tips

* The `guidance_scale` parameter controls the visual quality. We suggest using a guidance within [7, 9] for the 768p checkpoint during text-to-video generation, and 7 for the 384p checkpoint.
* The `video_guidance_scale` parameter controls the motion. A larger value increases the dynamic degree and mitigates the autoregressive generation degradation, while a smaller value stabilizes the video.
* For 10-second video generation, we recommend using a guidance scale of 7 and a video guidance scale of 5.
* **fp16 Support**: The model now supports `fp16` precision, which can reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance on compatible GPUs (Compute Capability >= 7.0). To use `fp16`, set `model_dtype='fp16'` when loading the model. If your GPU does not support `fp16`, the model will automatically fall back to `fp32` precision.

## Training

### 1. Training VAE

The hardware requirements for training VAE are at least 8 A100 GPUs. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/docs/VAE.md). This is a [MAGVIT-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737) like continuous 3D VAE, which should be quite flexible. Feel free to build your own video generative model on this part of VAE training code.

### 2. Finetuning DiT

The hardware requirements for finetuning DiT are at least 8 A100 GPUs. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/docs/DiT.md). We provide instructions for both autoregressive and non-autoregressive versions of Pyramid Flow. The former is more research oriented and the latter is more stable (but less efficient without temporal pyramid).

## Comparison

On VBench ([Huang et al., 2024](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_Leaderboard)), our method surpasses all the compared open-source baselines. Even with only public video data, it achieves comparable performance to commercial models like Kling ([Kuaishou, 2024](https://kling.kuaishou.com/en)) and Gen-3 Alpha ([Runway, 2024](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-gen-3-alpha)), especially in the quality score (84.74 vs. 84.11 of Gen-3) and motion smoothness.

![vbench](assets/vbench.jpg)

We conduct an additional user study with 20+ participants. As can be seen, our method is preferred over open-source models such as [Open-Sora](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) and [CogVideoX-2B](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) especially in terms of motion smoothness.
